# Analysis of Appleâ€™s Stock and Option
A simple analysis of Apple stock, calls, and puts using Black-Scholes and Geometric Brownian Motion. This was done for my mid-semester test on Computational Finance.

The stock data was taken from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL) from April 30th, 2021 up to April 29th, 2022, the analysis used the market closing price in particular. 
The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model was used to simulate some trading strategies for calls and puts which expired on October 21st, 2022.
